#  🌎 What's My IP ?

This is an application to display your current IP address, as well as a map of your current location, and some extra time/place info (in case you don't remember where you are 🧭😉) !

Click on the IP to copy it to your clipboard.

The app calls 2 separate APIs:

[Geo Ipify](https://geo.ipify.org) for the IP address itself and the timezone/location data
[Rest Countries](https://restcountries.eu/) for additional country info (like the flag)

# 🗺️ How about the map?

[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) + [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) are used to show a map of the user's current location.

*Fun fact:* While the app loads your data; you are in the middle of the dreaded Bermuda Triangle ⚓⛵🏴‍☠️ !
